Exercise 1.5: Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:
```scheme
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))
```
Then he evaluates the expression
```scheme
(test 0 (p))
```
What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule for the special form if is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)

Applicative-order evaluation (evaluate and apply)
```scheme
; (test 0 p)
;
; 0
```
The first step is to evaluate the symbol p to its value of p.
The second step evaluates the test and since the x parameter of the test equals 0, it evaluates to 0 and then applies that value.

Normal-order evaluation (expand then reduce)
```scheme
; (test 0 p)
;
; (if (= 0 0)
;     0
;     p)
;
; 0
```
