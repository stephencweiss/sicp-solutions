Exercise 1.6: Alyssa P. Hacker doesn’t see why if needs to be provided as a special form. “Why can’t I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of cond?” she asks. Alyssa’s friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she defines a new version of if:

(define (new-if predicate
                then-clause
                else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:

(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
5

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
0
Delighted, Alyssa uses new-if to rewrite the square-root program:

(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.

`if` is a special-form which evaluates the predicate prior to the branches. More specifically, by evaluating the predicate first, the interpreter _only_ evaluates _one_ branch in the special form of `if`. This is _not_ the case when we re-define `if` as `new-if`. Now, it behaves as usual with applicative-order evaluation. The resulting "de-special" form procedure ends up in an infinite loop because each branch is always called and in this case, that includes a recursive call to itself.
