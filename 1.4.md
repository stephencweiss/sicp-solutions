Exercise 1.4: Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

```scheme
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```
---
The `if` statement returns the operator `+` if `b` is greater than zero or `-` if it is less. This operator is then applied to the operands (`a` and `b`).
